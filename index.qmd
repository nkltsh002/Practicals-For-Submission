# First Peer-Reviewed Hand-In Assignment

Welcome to your first peer-reviewed assignment for the course. Below you will find the submission brief along with guidelines, rubrics, and FAQs.

## 1. Course Mark Contribution

This hand-in counts **2.5%** towards your final mark for the course.

## 2. Due Date

**Due Date:** Tuesday, **11 February, MIDNIGHT**.

## 3. Required Practicals

This assignment consists of three practical exercises:

-   **Prac 1:** [Link to Prac 1](#)
-   **Prac 2:** (uploaded to Amathuba under the Day Two / Three section)
-   **Practical Day Four:** [Link to Practical Day Four](#)

## 4. Submission Instructions

1.  **Render Your Quarter Site:**\
    Ensure your site is correctly generated in the `_site` (or `_book`) folder.

2.  **Zip the Rendered Site:**\
    Compress the rendered site into one zip file.

3.  **Upload:**\
    Submit the zip file via the assignment page on Amathuba.

4.  **Include GitHub URL:**\
    In your submission, clearly state the URL to your GitHub repository (e.g., `github.com/yourusername/yourrepo`) where your assignment code can be viewed.

## 5. Recommended Format for QMD Files

To make your submission easy to review: - Use clear headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to structure your document. - Echo key code chunks with `#| echo: true` so that the code is visible in the rendered document.

This ensures that your peers can quickly navigate your work and assess your code. If your code isnâ€™t visible, it might be marked down.

## 6. Rubric (Total: /100)

### 6.1 Rendered Quarter Site (/20)

-   **Full (20/20):** The rendered document is a Quarto project (i.e., a `_site`/`_book` folder).
-   **Partial (10/20):** The practicals are rendered using a literate programming approach (individual Quarto files, RMarkdown files, or a bookdown project) but not as a full Quarto project.
-   **None (0/20):** The site fails to render.

### 6.2 GitHub Repository URL (/20)

-   **Full (20/20):** A correct and accessible GitHub URL is provided that contains all the code.
-   **Partial (10/20):** A correct GitHub URL is provided but the code appears incomplete.
-   **None (0/20):** No GitHub URL is provided or it is completely incorrect/incomplete.

### 6.3 Practical Exercises (/20 each)

For each practical: - **Full (20/20):** The practical is completed correctly with all required components. - **Partial (10/20):** Some components are completed, but there are noticeable issues or omissions. - **None (0/20):** The practical is not attempted or is entirely incorrect.

> **Note:** Practical Day Four was previously labeled as Practical Day Five, but the numbering was updated.

## 7. FAQs

-   **How many Git/GitHub repositories are involved?**\
    One. Your project should include the following files and folders:

    -   `_site/`
    -   `prac-day-1.qmd`
    -   `prac2.qmd`
    -   `prac-day-four.qmd`
    -   `_quarto.yml`

-   **Should each question in each practical be answered in a separate qmd file?**\
    No. All questions for each practical should be answered within a single qmd file.

-   **I cannot get Quarto projects to work. Can I submit separate rendered HTML files?**\
    You can, but you will receive partial marks for that section of the rubric.

## 8. Marking Guidelines

We do not expect you to mark each question individually in the practicals. Instead, assess overall correctness and completeness.

## 9. Marking Queries

-   Remember, this assignment is only worth **2.5%** of your final mark.
-   If you have any queries regarding marking, please bring them to our attention for review.
